        I entered the world of software engineering late in life.  I was a teacher and an independent contractor for many years and I longed for a career that could blend my love of writing and learning new skills.  Upon completion of my time at the University of Oregon bootcamp, I will have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and other software languages.

        I grew up in Central Florida but after hurricanes and insanity, I moved my family to Oregon in 2005.  Part of my job is traveling the Pacific Northwest, where I have taken hundreds of photos of the natural beauty of the area. 
        I write in my spare time. I keep a blog and I have written eight novels that are for sale.
        Feel free to follow my project links.
